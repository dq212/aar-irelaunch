            At AARP, we understand that life happens, and a career break can
            occur at any stage, for any reason. Like caring for a parent,
            shuttling kids back and forth or bored with retirement.</p><h3>If you're
            ready to get back to work, we have good news.</h3> <p>AARP has partnered
            with industry leader <a href='https://www.irelaunch.com/' target="_blank">iRelaunch</a> to help people reenter the workforce
            after an extended break through paid internships that help you ease
            back into the office. The program has helped people all around the
            world—and now you can take advantage of it with resources, tools,
            coaching and advice.</p>

            to relaunch your career</h2>
          <p>
            Remember internships?  Now there's a way to get back on the job with a Returnship after being out of the workforce for an extended amount of time. AARP and iRelaunch are partnering with leading organizations looking for your experience and drive. And, that's a real advantage for you. Why not think about becoming a paid intern at a company that values your experience? A Returnship could have you back in the workforce in just 10-12 weeks.

succeed</h2>
          <p>
            And companies are, too.  With a tight labor market, many organizations are looking to bring diverse, qualified talent into the workforce in new ways. Returnships help them get to know you, and offer you a way to revive old skills, build new ones and grow your network—increasing your chances of getting hired.

        <p>
             If you haven’t been employed for at least two years, you are eligible for the Return to Work Program. To apply, visit the participating company’s Return to Work page (coming soon), upload your resume and complete the application. Each company manages their own program, from recruiting and onboarding to coaching and performance evaluation. Internships are typically 10-12 weeks, after which you may receive a job offer.
